                                        This
                                        rhythm is namely generated through the repetition of bodily political practices.
                                        Practice and rhythm become concomitant, and essential to the production of
                                        “counter-knowledge” and “counter-power” to de-centre the ocular-centric colonial

                                        wares donated from the museum-ship Sigyn, a wooden barque built in 1887 that

                                        past this island. In 2018, the ship needed new masts. Unlike last century, when
                                        Finland provided most European Empires with the timber and tar to build their
                                        fleets, when scouting for the mast material in 2018, only a handful of trees in

                                        of Finland were found to be of suitable size. The masts which compose the

                                        area bear witness to the transatlantic slave and timber trade as much as to the

                                        maritime trade, and in the 19th Century the appearance of the ritual in the area

                                        Key to this project is putting notions of tradition and salvaging into
                                        discussion.
                                        Following Mignolo & Walsh, we denounce how modernity was posited in
                                        contradistinction with tradition, enabling modernity to mobilise a fiction that
                                        defined socio-economic order and particular modes of subjectivities. In this
                                        fiction
                                        that became reality, tradition is posited as the predecessor of a civilised
                                        modernity, obfuscating the operating logic of coloniality. It is in this sense
                                        that
                                        we must deconstruct “tradition”, and valorise a diversity of historical
                                        processes.
                                        With Fields of May, we propose salvaging as a way to question and re-claim the
                                        meaning of traditions. Katriina Siivonen has put forward the concept of
                                        ‘heritage
                                        futures’ - as a departure from cultural heritage - in which the main concern is
                                        about preserving. Heritage futures is about developing rituals for ecological
                                        survival, and according to Siivonen, art is instrumental in this process.

                                        Could we re-imagine law to advocate and nurture multispecies legal ecologies? 
                                        According to Elina Raitinen, an ecosystems approach to law is crucial because the legal mindset thus far, which is based on the freedom of man, has been devastating. 
                                        She explains that ownership and state sovereignty are the two organising principles of legal modernity. 
                                        In this system, jurisprudence privileges the freedom of individuals and safeguards their achieved interests, which is incompatible with the current climate crisis. 
                                        Raitinen advocates for law needs to reorient itself from facilitating extractive free action by individuals to a responsible world-making. 
                                        And in this re-orientation, inter-dependency is central. In other words, an alternative ontology of understanding social and ecological systems as interrelated expressions of one unified, vulnerable living order. 
                                        In order for us to survive in the Anthropocene, we would need to unravel the priority of rights, 
                                         therefore, radical care and renewal must be brought to the heart of the conceptual system of justice, rather than free will. </p>

                                        in the 19th Century, the Midsummer Pole tradition is a demonstration of the

                                        Finland provided most European Empires with the timber and tar to build their

                                        Key to this project is putting notions of tradition and salvaging into
                                        discussion.
                                        Following Mignolo & Walsh, we denounce how modernity was posited in
                                        contradistinction with tradition, enabling modernity to mobilise a fiction that
                                        defined socio-economic order and particular modes of subjectivities. In this
                                        fiction
                                        that became reality, tradition is posited as the predecessor of a civilised
                                        modernity, obfuscating the operating logic of coloniality. It is in this sense
                                        that
                                        we must deconstruct “tradition”, and valorise a diversity of historical
                                        processes.
                                        With Fields of May, we propose salvaging as a way to question and re-claim the
                                        meaning of traditions. Katriina Siivonen has put forward the concept of
                                        ‘heritage
                                        futures’ - as a departure from cultural heritage - in which the main concern is
                                        about preserving. Heritage futures is about developing rituals for ecological
                                        survival, and according to Siivonen, art is instrumental in this process.

                                        Could we re-imagine law to advocate and nurture multispecies legal ecologies? 
                                        According to Elina Raitinen, an ecosystems approach to law is crucial because the legal mindset thus far, which is based on the freedom of man, has been devastating. 
                                        She explains that ownership and state sovereignty are the two organising principles of legal modernity. 
                                        In this system, jurisprudence privileges the freedom of individuals and safeguards their achieved interests, which is incompatible with the current climate crisis. 
                                        Raitinen advocates for law needs to reorient itself from facilitating extractive free action by individuals to a responsible world-making. 
                                        And in this re-orientation, inter-dependency is central. In other words, an alternative ontology of understanding social and ecological systems as interrelated expressions of one unified, vulnerable living order. 
                                        In order for us to survive in the Anthropocene, we would need to unravel the priority of rights, 
                                         therefore, radical care and renewal must be brought to the heart of the conceptual system of justice, rather than free will. </b></p>

                                    <p style="color: rgb(255 255 212 / 75%);"> A Witness Seminar is a format in which people with a specialised interest around
                                        a
                                        topic, issue of concern, or an event, gather and verbally exchange, discuss, and
                                        debate with the aim of advancing critical dialogue on the matter of address.
                                        During
                                        a seminar, participants are invited to speak from their position of situated
                                        knowledge and experience as a means to initiate and stimulate discussion. These
                                        conversations are often chaired and recorded. The seminar transcript becomes an
                                        archival source for future use that emphasises the capacities of
                                        interdisciplinary
                                        collaboration and embodied practice, much like the midsummer poles used to
                                        function
                                        in the archipelago. Though witness seminars have often situated themselves in
                                        contradistinction to oral history. <a class="fraudlink"
                                            href="https://www.instagram.com/la_fraud/">FRAUD</a> proposes a
                                        re-interpretation that welcomes constituencies outside academia as specialists
                                        in
                                        their own right, and integrates oral history as an affirmative grounding force,
                                        while manoeuvring the legitimacy conferred through the archival form.
                                        Fields of May instigates a series of witness seminars exploring the complex materialities of the Baltic. 
                                        These events discussing the potentiality of 
                                        more-than-human legal ecologies are chaired by the former masts of the Sigyn ship.

                                        Sagalund museum director John Bjorman has discussed how in the Finnish
                                        Archipelago
                                        in the 19th Century, the Midsummer Pole tradition is a demonstration of the
                                        community’s shipbuilding capacity, as well as a social display of collective
                                        organisation, depending on how well the village members could build and hoist
                                        this
                                        large structure together. The Midsummer Pole tradition in the archipelago was
                                        thus
                                        an important demonstration of a village’s ability to collaborate. To foster an
                                        exchange between traditional and contemporary practices, the Midsummer Mast and
                                        Fields of May were conceptualised and built in collaboration with shipwrights,
                                        carpenters, garlands makers, weavers and a plant whisperer.</p>

                                    Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, an Andean philosopher who is known for her contribution to
                                    postcolonial and subaltern studies, writes about a “rhythm with the cosmos”. This
                                    rhythm is namely generated through the repetition of bodily political practices.
                                    Practice and rhythm become concomitant, and essential to the production of
                                    “counter-knowledge” and “counter-power” to de-centre the ocular-centric colonial
                                    gaze. We propose here to consider the human as well as the non-human bodies to
                                    re-configure the otherwise Cartesian apparatus and anthropocentric legal system.
                                    Calling upon the bodily, the multiple-more-than-human bodily gestures to inhabit
                                    space-time. Listen to the rhythm of woven nets which recall the invisible woman’s
                                    work, to the mast and its archive of travels through wonder and unspeakable pain,
                                    and to the stinging nettle, the subaltern queer, queen of the healers. Rhythm calls
                                    attention to bodies’ centrality in attuning to the non-human environment, a
                                    more-than-critical-raw-materiality that is predicated upon non-transactional
                                    relationships of mutual respect.

                                    This installation consists of salvaged discarded masts, spars and other maritime
                                    wares donated from the museum-ship Sigyn, a wooden barque built in 1887 that crossed
                                    the oceans and seas for trade. As Seili is situated next to the old Baltic maritime
                                    trade route, where passenger ferries pass today, Sigyn would have routinely sailed
                                    past this island. In 2018, the ship needed new masts. Unlike last century, when
                                    Finland provided most European Empires with the timber and tar to build their
                                    fleets, when scouting for the mast material in 2018, only a handful of trees in all
                                    of Finland were found to be of suitable size. The masts which compose the seating
                                    area bear witness to the transatlantic slave and timber trade as much as to the
                                    changing nature of Finnish forests, now largely servicing pulp production.

                                    offering of good harvests, celebration of the beginning of the ‘light days’ (Celtic
                                    calendar). Here in the Archipelago, maypoles were bound to the liberalisation of
                                    maritime trade, and in the 19th Century the appearance of the ritual in the area
                                    demonstrated the prowess of the village&apos;s shipbuilding capacity, and ability to
                                    collaborate. Earlier in England, these structures also acted as popular tribunals
                                    where governors, barons and kings were deposed and punished if ruled guilty. ‘May
                                    Poles’ were hoisted in fields and meadows known as the ‘Ey-commons’ or ‘Fields of
                                    May’. Fields of May operated as the highest court in popular law - now known for
                                    example as ‘commons law’. Juridical and environmental maypole traditions thus inform
                                    Fields of May as an infrastructure which aims to foster an inquiry into the reach of
                                    the so-called Blue Economy in the Baltic Sea, and to imagine a legal system rooted

                                    The 2022 EU Directive on Maritime Spatial Planning is the most recent blueprint
                                    towards the full exploitation of marine & forest resources in the Baltic Sea; the
                                    response to the deep economic crisis ushered by the COVID pandemic. And yet, as
                                    shown by the People’s Tribunals on the ‘Blue Economy‘ across the Indian Ocean
                                    region, this model is based on fundamentally erroneous premises such as the notion
                                    that accelerated growth can bring reductions of greenhouse emissions, that oceans
                                    are natural capital and environmental services provider, or that Blue growth is
                                    beneficial for both the environment and economic ‘development’. Such assumptions are
                                    devastating seas and forests worldwide. Fields of May aims to instigate an enquiry
                                    into such economic paradigms, and create an architecture of engagement that fosters
                                    kinship rituals, more-than-traditional knowledge exchanges and critical legal
                                    ecologies that help to produce apprehensions of forest/marine environments beyond
                                    predatory regimes of value.

                                    Key to this project is putting notions of tradition and salvaging into discussion.
                                    Following Mignolo & Walsh, we denounce how modernity was posited in
                                    contradistinction with tradition, enabling modernity to mobilise a fiction that
                                    defined socio-economic order and particular modes of subjectivities. In this fiction
                                    that became reality, tradition is posited as the predecessor of a civilised
                                    modernity, obfuscating the operating logic of coloniality. It is in this sense that
                                    we must deconstruct “tradition”, and valorise a diversity of historical processes.
                                    With Fields of May, we propose salvaging as a way to question and re-claim the
                                    meaning of traditions. Katriina Siivonen has put forward the concept of ‘heritage
                                    futures’ - as a departure from cultural heritage - in which the main concern is
                                    about preserving. Heritage futures is about developing rituals for ecological
                                    survival, and according to Siivonen, art is instrumental in this process.

                                        Could we re-imagine law to advocate and nurture multispecies legal ecologies? 
                                        According to Elina Raitinen, an ecosystems approach to law is crucial because the legal mindset thus far, which is based on the freedom of man, has been devastating. 
                                        She explains that ownership and state sovereignty are the two organising principles of legal modernity. 
                                        In this system, jurisprudence privileges the freedom of individuals and safeguards their achieved interests, which is incompatible with the current climate crisis. 
                                        Raitinen advocates for law needs to reorient itself from facilitating extractive free action by individuals to a responsible world-making. 
                                        And in this re-orientation, inter-dependency is central. In other words, an alternative ontology of understanding social and ecological systems as interrelated expressions of one unified, vulnerable living order. 
                                        In order for us to survive in the Anthropocene, we would need to unravel the priority of rights, 
                                         therefore, radical care and renewal must be brought to the heart of the conceptual system of justice, rather than free will.

                                    A Witness Seminar is a format in which people with a specialised interest around a
                                    topic, issue of concern, or an event, gather and verbally exchange, discuss, and
                                    debate with the aim of advancing critical dialogue on the matter of address. During
                                    a seminar, participants are invited to speak from their position of situated
                                    knowledge and experience as a means to initiate and stimulate discussion. These
                                    conversations are often chaired and recorded. The seminar transcript becomes an
                                    archival source for future use that emphasises the capacities of interdisciplinary

                                    legitimacy conferred through the archival form.
                                    Fields of May instigates a series of witness seminars exploring the complex materialities of the Baltic. 
                                    These events discussing the potentiality of 
                                    more-than-human legal ecologies are chaired by the former masts of the Sigyn ship.

                                    Ilppo Vuorinen, former director of the Archipelago Research Institute, explicates
                                    the mostly forgotten places of common use in the archipelago, the commons as sites
                                    of silent knowledge, and how that knowledge is disappearing with the privatisation
                                    of these spaces. To discuss these practices and places is also a means of commoning.
                                    Other effaced histories include women’s crucial role in boat building and navigation
                                    in the archipelago. Their importance is mostly undocumented. How can we address
                                    gendered and knowledge exchange gaps in the Archive?

                                    Another aspect of this project is a collaboration of building knowledges. The
                                    Sagalund museum director John Bjorman has discussed how in the Finnish Archipelago
                                    in the 19th Century, the Midsummer Pole tradition is a demonstration of the
                                    community’s shipbuilding capacity, as well as a social display of collective
                                    organisation, depending on how well the village members could build and hoist this
                                    large structure together. The Midsummer Pole tradition in the archipelago was thus
                                    an important demonstration of a village’s ability to collaborate. To foster an
                                    exchange between traditional and contemporary practices, the Midsummer Mast and
                                    Fields of May were conceptualised and built in collaboration with shipwrights,
                                    carpenters, garlands makers, weavers and a plant whisperer.

                                    Its material specificity invites human and non-humans from all fields to converge around 
                                    its masts to formulate post-extractive futures.
