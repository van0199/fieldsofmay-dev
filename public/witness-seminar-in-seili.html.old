                                                Beached on the island of Seili, the salvaged masts of the 19th century Sigyn trade barque chair Fields of May; a witness seminar in which artists and scientists examine how critical raw materials coalesce in the archipelago, creating an archive of testimonies addressing the impact of the blue economy.
            
            The first witness seminar took place in May 2022 to discuss potential more-than-human legal ecologies from the perspective of the island of Seili, the research undertaken there by the Archipelago Research Institute, and artists which have been attentive to the island and its layered ecologies.

                                                A Witness Seminar is a format in which people with a specialised interest around a topic, issue of concern, or an event, gather and verbally exchange, discuss, and debate with the aim of advancing critical dialogue on the matter of address. During a seminar, participants are invited to speak from their position of situated knowledge and experience, as a means to initiate and stimulate discussion. These conversations are often chaired and recorded. The seminar transcript becomes an archival source for future use that emphasises the capacities of interdisciplinary collaboration and embodied practice. Though witness seminars have often situated themselves in contradistinction to oral history. FRAUD proposes a re-interpretation that welcomes constituencies outside academia as specialists in their own right, and integrates oral history as an affirmative grounding force, while manoeuvring the legitimacy conferred through the archival form.

                                            <p>
                                                In this case, the witness seminar in Seili s chaired by the former masts which comprise Fields of May (pictured above), its material specificity and history guide the discussion, together with the wind sock.                                </p>

                                                                                Its former masts act as a structure to chair witness seminars and events to discuss the convergence of critical raw materials in the archipelago, specifically in relation to Seili.                                         </p>
                                                                            <p>

                                                                                The archipelagos close to the earth's poles are joined in the winter by the icy cover of the water's surface, frozen highways running across oceans and seas. 
                                                                                Seili is also positioned next to a well-travelled route, where trade ships once passed (including the Sigyn), now mostly populated by cruise ships which double up as cargo transport. 
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                These gargantuan ships trace the global entanglements of extraction. The ships carrying containers of phosphate rich industrial fertiliser glide along the Baltic. Once it is delivered, the phosphate run-off from agricultural land in turn contributes to the sea's eutrophication. 
                                                                                It too cannot breathe. The seabed is choking. Shrinking plankton and fish are adapting to this stifling environment.
                                                                                 For several decades the Archipelago Research Institute in Seili has been measuring the shrinking Herring and tracing its relationship to the morphing plankton, namely due to changes in salinity and eutrophication.

                                                                                    Fisheries are becoming a critical raw material. This new material propels the blue economy, together with deep-sea carbon capture.                                     </p>

                                                                                        Carbon too has become a material, abstracted from its material condition of production as well as its paramount social and environmental relations, to be traded and offset.                                          </p>
                                                                                        <p>

                                    Beached on the island of Seili, the salvaged masts of the 19th century Sigyn trade barque chair Fields of May; a witness seminar in which artists and scientists examine how critical raw materials coalesce in the archipelago, creating an archive of testimonies addressing the impact of the blue economy.
    
    The first witness seminar took place in May 2022 to discuss potential more-than-human legal ecologies from the perspective of the island of Seili, the research undertaken there by the Archipelago Research Institute, and artists which have been attentive to the island and its layered ecologies. 
    
    A Witness Seminar is a format in which people with a specialised interest around a topic, issue of concern, or an event, gather and verbally exchange, discuss, and debate with the aim of advancing critical dialogue on the matter of address. During a seminar, participants are invited to speak from their position of situated knowledge and experience, as a means to initiate and stimulate discussion. These conversations are often chaired and recorded. The seminar transcript becomes an archival source for future use that emphasises the capacities of interdisciplinary collaboration and embodied practice. Though witness seminars have often situated themselves in contradistinction to oral history.  <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/la_fraud/">FRAUD</a> proposes a re-interpretation that welcomes constituencies outside academia as specialists in their own right, and integrates oral history as an affirmative grounding force, while manoeuvring the legitimacy conferred through the archival form.

                                    Fields of May takes as a point of departure a salvaged 19th century barque. Its former masts act as a structure to chair witness seminars and events to discuss the convergence of critical raw materials in the archipelago, specifically in relation to Seili. 
                                    
                                    Islands have been considered as microcosms, worlds in themselves, yet the perceived boundary between land and sea is a porous one. The archipelagos close to the earth's poles are joined in the winter by the icy cover of the water's surface, frozen highways running across oceans and seas. Seili is also positioned next to a well-travelled route, where trade ships once passed (including the Sigyn), now mostly populated by cruise ships which double up as cargo transport. 
                                    
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    These gargantuan ships trace the global entanglements of extraction. The ships carrying containers of phosphate rich industrial fertiliser glide along the Baltic. Once it is delivered, the phosphate run-off from agricultural land in turn contributes to the sea's eutrophication. It too cannot breathe. The seabed is choking. Shrinking plankton and fish are adapting to this stifling environment. For several decades the Archipelago Research Institute in Seili has been measuring the shrinking Herring and tracing its relationship to the morphing plankton, namely due to changes in salinity and eutrophication.<a href="#footnotedesktop"><span class="link">1</span> </a>
    
                                    Fisheries worldwide are in danger, more than 70% are overfished according to the latest widely cited AHO report. Fish are counted and traded like stock, commodities like phosphate and carbon. Fisheries are becoming a critical raw material. This new material propels the blue economy, together with deep-sea carbon capture. 
                                    
                                    Despite the forestry ministry of Finland affirming that its industry constitutes a positive carbon sink, the country's primary industry contributes to the Baltic's eutrophication. Carbon too has become a material, abstracted from its material condition of production as well as its paramount social and environmental relations, to be traded and offset.

No-go zones where the cold war's weapons were dumped. The eutrophic strata bear witness to Soviet disarmament. As such phosphate, carbon, and fisheries coalesce in Seili and gesture towards the inter-relationships of wider ecologies of extraction. 
        
                                        With that said, as much as they look outwards, islands also look inwards, and as such have been misunderstood as ideal sites for penal colonies and other                                 such unwanted.

The forestry ministry also used the island for its own experiments. These histories imbued in the island are leaking through the Baltic's stratified seabed, rich with phosphate, carbon and fossilised fish. Can we attune to these layers to formulate post-extractive futures?
